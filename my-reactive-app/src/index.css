/* 
  The @tailwind directives are processed by a build tool to generate the necessary CSS.
  If you are seeing an "Unknown at rule @tailwind" error, it means your development server
  or build process is not configured correctly to handle Tailwind CSS.
  
  Please ensure you have followed the Tailwind CSS installation guide for your framework,
  which typically involves:
  1. Installing tailwindcss, postcss, and autoprefixer.
  2. Creating and configuring tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.
  3. Running the build process that uses PostCSS to compile your CSS.

  The original code is correct for a Tailwind CSS project, so no changes are made.
